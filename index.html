                            Age: 36. Experience in coding: Bootcamp, hours at home and counting. Strengths: Grit, team player, friendly, problem solver, communication skills, positive attitude and optimistic. Weaknesses: "I work too hard, I care too much, and sometimes I can be too invested in my job." (Michael Scott). Jokes aside, I have owned a business built from the ground up. Around ten employees including sub-contractors and about a million dollars in yearly revenues. I have two dogs and I’m soon to be a father for a little girl. I already call her “my favorite mistake”. Always willing to learn and always ready for a challenge. My assignment writing this bio is pretty much due, so this will have to be it for now.
